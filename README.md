# PGallery
A personal art website with forum feature built using **Python Django**. 

This is a course project under Web Engineering. I was inspired to make this project because we did not have a place to store the artworks we made in the past.

**Pages**
1. P1 (pam's artworks)
2. P2 (pau's artworks)
3. Forum (place for visitors to leave comments)
4. About


**Updates:**

_10/09/2023_
- Migrated files from a different account so I had to test if this is working.
- For now, the forum.html is the only page working which was the only requirement to pass my course last 2 years.
- I am currently redesigning the wireframes and relearning Javascript for the other elements needed for this website.
- I hope to continue and finish this project by the end of the year =)
